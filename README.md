# Geolocation Remote 
### Control the Location of Your Mobile Device

It is hard to test mobile applications where the location changes freequently. This tool lets you take over control of your `navigator.geolocation` by overriding the existing APIs using data from a simple socket connection.

This a small app to run a geolocation webapp in the browser with debugging possibilities. The webapp in question is inserted as an iframe and the geolocation api is overwritten to use the one we provide. This one is build to work with google maps to show where exactly we are now in the webapp. 

## Installation

You can clone and build the remote control yourself. It's a yo/grunt project.

But you can copy the contents of the dist folder (which is the complete remote folder) to your webapp root and access you webapp with http://[webapp root]/remote.

Add client-scripts.js in the remote scripts folder to tweak your app behaviour. Use it for your own scripts that you need to debug your webapp with but dont want to remove for your build process. The default one is not used for the remote-control build, allthough you could just copy it as a starting point.

## Example

To have an example what you can do just clone this repo. Do <code>npm install</code> and <code>bower install</code>.
Then run <code>grunt server</code>. A page will open in your browser and you can play a little. 

You can open the no-embed version (link is provided in the app) in every device to check different locations.
In the no-embed version you dont have the possibility to log client data to the remote.
